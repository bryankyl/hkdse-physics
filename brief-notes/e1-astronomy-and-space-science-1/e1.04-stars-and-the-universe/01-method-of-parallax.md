# 01 Method of Parallax

Parallax can be used to measure the distance of a star away from the the solar system.

**Phenomenon:**

* When we focus at an object and move from one position to another, we discover that the apparent position of the object will shift relative to the background.
* The further you move, the more the object shifted apart.

**Principle:**

* When our view moves from viewpoint A to viewpoint B, the angle and the line of vision will change.
* At viewpoint A, the line of vision will be on the blue background, and then white background and finally be on red at viewpoint B.
* In astronomy, the Earth revolves around the Sun. From the figure below, If an observer aims at star A in January, the background star is star B.
* In July, the Earth goes to the another side of the Earth's orbit. The background star is star C.
* The Earth, the Sun and star A form a triangle. By using simple trigonometry, we can measure the distance of star A away from us. We will talk about the method in next part.

**Application of Parallax:**

1. Human Perception of Depth When we observe an object, our left eye and right eye produce different views due to parallax. By interpreting both views by human brain, a perception of 3-dimension and **depth of view** can be obtained. We can barely feel the distance of the object apart from us.
2. 3-Dimensional Camera The conventional photo images and videos provide us ONE flat screen for our TWO eyes. If two image-capturing devices are aligned side-by-side. It can generate two particular views at the same time, just like our left and right eyes. By using an Virtual Reality player or 3-D TV, static image and motion videos with **depth of view** can be played and enjoyed by the audience.
