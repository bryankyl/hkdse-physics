# 01 Basics of Light

Light is a source of energy.  
It can be transmitted through a **straight path** in **vacuum** at a very high speed \(i.e. $$300000000\text{ m s}^{-1}$$ \).

Ray is the basic unit of light.  
Beam is a collection of rays which comes from the same light source.  
There are three types of beams:

| Parallel beam | Divergent beam | Convergent beam |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
