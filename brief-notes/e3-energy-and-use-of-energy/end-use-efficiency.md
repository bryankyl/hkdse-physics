# End-use Efficiency

Unavoidably, some energy is lost when using an electrical appliance. Much energy is lost as heat, light or sound.  
End-use efficiency is used to describe the percentage of useful energy to its total energy consumed.

$$
\text{End-use Efficiency}=\frac{\text{useful energy}}{\text{total energy consumed}}\times100\%
