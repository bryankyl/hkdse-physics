# 04 Pressure

### Definition of Pressure

Pressure is defined as the force exerted on per unit area of the surface  
The unit of pressure is pascal \($$\text{Pa}$$\) or Newton per squared metre \($$\text{N m}^{-2}$$\).

$$
\text{pressure}=\frac{\text{force exerted on the surface}}{\text{contact area}}
$$

### Use of Pressure in Daily Life

There are sharp edges in knives.  
There are sharp heads in arrows.  
It can reduce the contact area and raise the pressure by using the same amount of force.

### Gas Pressure

Gas molecules are moving randomly inside a container.  
They exert a force at the moment when hitting with the surface of the container.  
Gas Pressure:

$$
\text{gas pressure}=\frac{\text{force exerted on the container surface}}{\text{area of the container}}
$$

### Atmospheric Pressure

Atmospheric pressure is the pressure generated by the atmosphere of Earth.  
Atmospheric pressure changes from time to time, but the average value is about $$1.05\times10^5\text{ Pa}$$.
