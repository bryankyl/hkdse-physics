# 05 Boyle's Law

### Boyle's Law:

Gas pressure is inversely proportional to the volume.

$$
P\propto\frac{1}{V}\:\:\:\text{or}\:\:\: PV=\text{constant}
$$

In $$P\text{-}V$$ graph \(Figure \(a\)\), the rectangular area enclosed by the point on the curve is $$nRT$$. When temperature increases, the curve shifts upwards and rightwards and the rectangular area increases.  
In $$P\text{-}\frac{1}{V}$$ graph \(Figure \(b\)\), the slope of the linear graph is $$nRT$$. When temperature increases, the slope of the graph increases.
