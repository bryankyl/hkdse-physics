# 05 Boyle's Law

### Boyle's Law:

Gas pressure is inversely proportional to the volume.

$$
P\propto\frac{1}{V}\:\:\:\text{or}\:\:\: PV=\text{constant}
$$

In $$P\text{-}V$$ graph \(Figure \(a\)\), the rectangular area enclosed by the point on the curve is $$nRT$$. When temperature increases, the curve shifts upwards and rightwards and the rectangular area increases.  
In $$P\text{-}\frac{1}{V}$$ graph \(Figure \(b\)\), the slope of the linear graph is $$nRT$$. When temperature increases, the slope of the graph increases.

### Experiment of Boyle's Law

1. At initial state, record the values of pressure $$P$$ and volume $$V$$.
2. Push the piston slowly, repeat step 1 for about 5-8 different values of pressure and volume.
3. Plot the $$P\text{-}V$$ or $$P\text{-}\frac{1}{V}$$ graph from the data collected in steps 1-2.
