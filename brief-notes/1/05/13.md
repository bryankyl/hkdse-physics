| kinetic energy model | ideal gas |
| :--- | :--- |
| metal beads | gas molecules |
| volume of the column below the piston | volume occupied by gas |
| weight of the piston | pressure |
| voltage of motor | temperature |

| action in the model |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| increase of the voltage |  |
| add more weight to the piston |  |
| add more metal beads |  |

| Gas laws |  |
