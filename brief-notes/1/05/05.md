# 05 Number of Moles

There are many molecules in gas, but in fact it is "countable".  
Amedeo Avogadro discovered that there are $$6.02\times10^{23}$$ molecules in 12 g of carbon-12. The number is regarded as **Avogadro constant**.

$$
N_\text{A}=6.02\times10^{23}
$$

  
We usually use moles to represent gas which:

$$
1\text{ mol}=6.02\times10^{23}\text{ units}
$$
