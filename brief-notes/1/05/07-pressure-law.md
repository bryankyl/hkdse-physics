# 07 Pressure Law

### Definition of Pressure Law

Pressure $$P$$ of a gas is directly proportional to the temperature $$T$$ of the gas, which the volume $$V$$ is kept constant.

$$
\frac{P}{T}=\text{constant}
$$

In $$P\text{-}T$$ graph, the slope of the straight line is $$\frac{nR}{V}$$. When volume $$V$$ increases, the slope of the straight line decreases.
