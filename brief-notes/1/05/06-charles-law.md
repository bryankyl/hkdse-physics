# 06 Charles' Law

### Definition of Charles' Law

Volume $$V$$ of a gas is directly proportional to the temperature $$T$$ of the gas, which the pressure $$P$$ is kept constant.  
Charles' law is also known as "**Thermal Expansion**" in common sense.

$$
\frac{V}{T}=\text{constant}
$$

In $$V\text{-}T$$ graph, the slope of the straight line is $$\frac{nR}{P}$$. When pressure $$P$$ increases, the slope of the straight line decreases.
