# 06 Charles' Law

### Definition of Charles' Law

Volume $$V$$ of a gas is directly proportional to the temperature $$T$$ of the gas, which the pressure $$P$$ is kept constant.  
Charles' law is also known as "**Thermal Expansion**" in common sense.

$$
\frac{V}{T}=\text{constant}
$$

In $$V\text{-}T$$ graph, the slope of the straight line is $$\frac{nR}{P}$$. When pressure $$P$$ increases, the slope of the straight line decreases.

### Experiment of Charles' Law

1. Water bath is heated up by the Bunsen burner.
2. Remove the Bunsen burner.
3. Stir the water well until the temperature is even.
4. Record the height of the gas column
