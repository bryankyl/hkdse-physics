# 05 Boyle's Law

### Definition of Boyle's Law:

Gas pressure $$P$$ is inversely proportional to the volume $$V$$ of the gas.

$$
P\propto\frac{1}{V}\:\:\:\text{or}\:\:\: PV=\text{constant}
$$

In $$P\text{-}V$$ graph \(Figure \(a\)\), the rectangular area enclosed by the point on the curve is $$nRT$$. When temperature increases, the curve shifts upwards and rightwards and the rectangular area increases.  
In $$P\text{-}\frac{1}{V}$$ graph \(Figure \(b\)\), the slope of the linear graph is $$nRT$$. When temperature increases, the slope of the graph increases.

### Experiment of Boyle's Law

1. Record the values of pressure $$P$$ and volume $$V$$.
2. Push the piston slowly, repeat step 1 for about 5-8 different values of pressure and volume.
3. Plot the $$P\text{-}V$$ or $$P\text{-}\frac{1}{V}$$ graph from the data collected in steps 1-2.

#### Experiment Sources of Errors

| Source of Error | Way to Improve |
| :--- | :--- |
| There is space inside the rubber tubing which causes error in measurement of volume. | Use a shorter rubber tubing. |
| Pushing of piston quickly may accelerate the gas molecules and increase the temperature. | Push the piston as slow as possible. |
| When the syringe is held by hand, the body temperature may increase the temperature of gas. | Do not hold the syringe with hand. |
| Gas may leak between the syringe and the piston. | Make sure the syringe and piston are air-tight. |
