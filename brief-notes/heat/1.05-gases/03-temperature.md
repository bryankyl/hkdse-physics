# 03 Temperature

At the end of previous part, the volume at temperature $$-273\degree\text{C}$$ is $$0\text{ m}^3$$ theoretically.  
Absolute zero \($$-273\degree\text{C}$$\) is regarded as the beginning point of all temperature.

In Physics, we use Kelvin temperature \(instead of Celsius temperature\) in calculation involving gases, which

>

$$\text{K}=\degree\text{C}+273$$
