# 03 Temperature

### Definition of Absolute Temperature

At the end of previous part, the volume at temperature $$-273\degree\text{C}$$ is $$0\text{ m}^3$$ theoretically.  
Absolute zero \($$-273\degree\text{C}$$\) is regarded as the beginning point of all temperature.

In Physics, we use Kelvin temperature or Absolute temperature \(instead of Celsius temperature\) in calculation involving gases, which

$$
\text{K} = \degree\text{C}+273
$$

The unit of temperature is kelvin \($$\text{K}$$\).

### Properties of Gas at Absolute Zero

At absolute zero:

* The speed and average kinetic energy of gas molecules are assume to be zero.
* The gas is assumed to take up zero volume
* The gas is assumed to have zero gas pressure.
