# 04 Pressure

Pressure is defined as the force exerted on per unit area of the surface:

$$
\text{pressure}=\frac{\text{force exerted on the surface}}{\text{contact area}}
$$

Gas molecules are moving randomly inside a container.  
They exert a force at the moment when colliding with the surface of the container.  
Gas Pressure:

$$
\text{gas pressure}=\frac{\text{Force exerted on the container surface}}{\text{area of the container}}
$$
