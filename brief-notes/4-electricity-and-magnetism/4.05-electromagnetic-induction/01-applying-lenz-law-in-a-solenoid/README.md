# 01 Applying Lenz Law in a Solenoid

When a magnet moves towards or away a magnet, a current is induced. 

> #### **Lenz Law:**
>
> The direction of induced current generates a magnetic field which is always opposing the motion of the magnet.

To decide the direction of induced current in the solenoid, you can use the **Right-Hand Grip Rule**.
