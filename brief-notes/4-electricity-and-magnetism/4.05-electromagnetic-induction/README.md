# 4.05 Electromagnetic Induction

Electromagnetic induction is the process of **generating electricity** \(induced electromotive force\) by change of magnetic flux linkage through a solenoid, a coil and a piece of wire.

When an e.m.f. is induced in a **complete circuit**, a current is induced by the e.m.f. and circulates around the circuit where it obeys **Ohm's law**, i.e. $$\varepsilon = IR$$.

Electromagnetic induction must obey the following two physical laws:

> #### Faraday's Law:
>
> The induced e.m.f. is **directly proportional** to the **rate of change of magnetic flux linkage** passing through the solenoid, coil or a piece of wire.

> #### Lenz Law:
>
> The magnetic induction **always oppose** to the change of magnetic flux linkage.
